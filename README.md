# Drawing_constellation_with_canvas
Wanna look your constellation sign at the Sky? you can. With this html file.

<strong>How I did it?</strong>

<stron>Conditionals</strong>, that's all what i could tell you. Using <strong>if - else if - else</strong>, I could do this (don't knew Switch).

<strong>Js</strong>

1. I made all JavaScript apart linking .js file, i started creating all conditionals i'll need, into those conditionals with <strong>stars function</strong> .

2. I created points simulating stars and after that linking it with <strong>star_lines function</strong>.

3. it change when you'll press different <strong>number keys</strong> to choose any sign <strong>like cancer= 4</strong> then you press 4 and you'll see stars and star_lines in the sky.
