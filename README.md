# Drawing_constellation_with_canvas
ðŸŒŒ Do you wanna look at your constellation sign in the Sky? It may not be possible now but you can do something similar virtually with this canvas file, just copy it on your computer and run the html file!

<strong> How I did it?</strong>

1. I used <strong>Conditionals</strong> to show a different canvas drawing based on what zodiac sign user choosed in the beggining of the page.

2. <strong>Drawing canvas in JavaScript</strong>: I created a canvas and then started to make two main functions for drawing the different zodiac signs, one for points in the canvas (stars) and another for lines that connects these points to form a zodiac sign image (star_lines).
